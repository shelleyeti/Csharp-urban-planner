# Practice: Urban Planner Part 1

## Instructions
In this exercise, you are going to define your own Building type and create several instances of it to design your own virtual city. Create a class named Building in the Building.cs file and define the following fields, properties, and methods.

# Practice: Urban Planner Part 2

## Instructions
Now you need to create a type to represent your city. Here are the requirements for the class. You determine if/when to use fields, properties, a constructor, and methods.

Name of the city.
The mayor of the city.
Year the city was established.
A collection of all of the buildings in the city.
A method to add a building to the city.
Remember, each class should be in its own file. Create a City.cs file and define the City class in there. Make sure it's in the same namespace as your other classes.

Once the class is defined to your liking, refactor your code in Main() to create a new city instance and add your buildings to it. Once all buildings are in the city, refactor your code that outputs the building info to the console to be inside a foreach loop that iterate the city's building collection.
